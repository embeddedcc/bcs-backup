    * `grunt releaseNotes:since:[start]:[finish]` will show the release notes starting after the start version and
        ending on the finish version. If no finish is provided, notes will be provided until the latest version.
        These are displayed and the string is set on the grunt config as `releaseNotes.notes` for use in templating.
    * `releaseNotes:latest` will display the release notes for the latest version, and it will add that string to the
        grunt config as `releaseNotes.notes` for use in templating.
