  "readme": "# grunt-release-notes\n> A grunt plugin to manage creation of a release notes section in your README. See this repo for example usage.\n\nThis is multi task, see [Gruntfile](https://github.com/pajtai/grunt-release-notes/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L18) and the \"Release Notes\" section\nat the bottom of this file for example usage.\n\nThe task will fail if the current package.json.version does not have a corresponding file in the release notes directory.\nThe plugin will also generate a markdown unordered list of links to version release notes with display dates which will\nbe saved on `grunt.config.releaseNotes.notes`. The notes string can then be used to create the `README.md` from a `README.template`\nthat uses grunt templating.\n\n_Comes with a companion task - `grunt notes:since` -  that will show the contents of your release notes files starting at one version and ending at another._\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-release-notes --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-release-notes');\n```\n\n## The \"releaseNotes\" task\n\n### Overview\nIn your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `releaseNotes` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n    releaseNotes : {\n        readmePath : 'README.md',\n        templatePath : 'templates/README.template.md'\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### Options\n* `notesDirectory` - The directory in which your release notes are stored.\n    * default : `release_notes`\n* `versionSeparator` - The character used to separate the version number from the display date in the release notes file names.\n    * default : `_`\n* `notesField` - The field on `grunt.config.releaseNotes` which will be used to create the generate release notes string.\n    * default : `notes`\n\n### Task level fields\n* `src` - If this field and `readmePath` are both defined, then the grunt template at `templatePath` will be used to generate the README at `readmePath` using `grunt.config` as the template data.\n* `dst` - If this field and `templatePath` are both defined, then the grunt template at `templatePath` will be used to generate the README at `readmePath` using `grunt.config` as the template data.\n* `baseLinkPath` - The base of the path that will be used to generate the links to the release notes. For example : `https://github.com/Solid-Interactive/masseuse/blob/master/`\n\n## releaseNotes:since:[from]:[until] task\n\n`grunt releaseNotes:since:[start]:[finish]` will show the release notes starting after the start version and ending on the finish version. If no finish is provided, notes will be provided until the latest version. These are displayed and the string is set on the grunt config as `releaseNotes.notes` for use in templating.\n\n## releaseNotes:latest task\n\n`releaseNotes:latest` will display the release notes for the latest version, and it will add that string to the grunt config as `releaseNotes.notes` for use in templating.\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.
